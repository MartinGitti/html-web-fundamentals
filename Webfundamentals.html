		<header><b>What to consider when adding images to your web page:</b></header>

		<p>Remember that when images are added to a web page that all users use different devices to view the web page. Keep in mind that all devices have different screen sizes, resolutions etc.

		A developer should always consider using responsive image codes that work a lot better and allows the most effective way for users to view the images on different devices without altering the image too much.</p>

<h4>1. What is Web 3.0 and how is it different from Web 1.0 and Web 2.0? </h4>

	<ul>
		<li>From my own understanding, web 3.0 is the new age internet that is way more advanced from the first static web pages that existed.

		<li>It has evolved to be far more exciting, apealing and allows users to interact in multiple ways using various avenues. Allows users to have acces to so many different web pages all at once.</li>

		<li>It has become so interactive with users that it appears to be more human-like than just something controlled by humans with automatic replies and responces to the users actions.</li>

	 	<li>It is faster and more convenient for users to use and to go from one web page to another via links like hash tags and thousands of different portals.</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	

<h5><em>How Web 3.0 is different from web 2.0 and web 1.0:</em></h5>

	<ul>
		<li>The web 1.0 only allowed users to view information. 
		(Extremely limited)</li>

		<li>Web 2.0 allowed users to interact with the web page in the form of adding information to it such as personal details, comments etc.</li>

		<li>Web 3.0 allows users to do so much more, to have all information stored accross multiple devises, to make changes that reflect instantaneosly on all devises once synced with one another.

		Web pages are more personalised for users according to information gathered from all the users information that's stored. It is a massive web of information that can be stored and shared anywhere and everywhere.</li>
	</ul>

<h4>2. What are the functional differences between the front-end of a web application and its back-end?
</h4>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Front-end web application refers to all the information that is available for users to see or interact with oposed to back-end web application refers to the more technical side of web developement that users don't see or have access to, only web developers have acces to this kind of information and are able to edit and solve problems where neccesary.</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<hr>


 <h4>3. In your own words, explain the process that takes place from when you type a URL into the address bar in your browser until you finally view the page you have requested:</h4>

	<ul>
 		<li><b>Step 1:</b> The user enters a domain name in the search bar in the form of a URL(universal resource link).</li>
 		
 		<li><b>Step 2:</b>The browser then uses the link's information as a pathway to find it's location in the world wide web, using the internet which allows all the information shared around the world to flow freely from one device to another.</li>

 		<li><b>Step 3:</b> The browser luckily aids as a translator, translating all the code information as a graphic appearance or in a way that users are able to understand.</li>
 	

 		<li><b>Step 4:</b> Once the information's location is traced and retrieved, it translates all the code information. This allows the user to view or interact with the front-end web page information.</li>
	</ul>
